# Fibonacci Sequence
This is a Python implementation for a program that takes either the maximum value that the Fibonacci sequence will stop at or the number of Fibonacci terms that should be generated. The maximum value the sequence will stop at has higher priority than the number of terms that should be displayed. User input is validated, which avoids Python's `ValueError` no matter what the user provides.

This program requires Python 3 which can be installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

First, a virtual environment can be created and activated using the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Then, the required Python packages need to be installed which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file using the command below:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start the program, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
The project idea was obtained from [karan/Projects#numbers](https://github.com/karan/Projects#numbers).
