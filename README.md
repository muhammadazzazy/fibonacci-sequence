# Fibonacci Sequence
This is a Python implementation for a program that takes either the maximum value that the Fibonacci sequence will stop at or the number of Fibonacci terms that should be generated. The maximum value the sequence will stop at has higher priority than the number of terms that should be displayed. User input is validated, which avoids Python's `ValueError` no matter what the user provides.

This program requires Python 3 which can be installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To start the program, run the command below in a shell:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
The project idea was obtained from [karan/Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects#numbers).
